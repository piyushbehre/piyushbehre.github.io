I'm currently working as a Program Manager at Microsoft.
I'm fluent in JavaScript, Python, and C++.

I'm an avid traveler (27 countries and counting).
I now live in California with my [wife](http://www.prashima.com), after having lived in France, Singapore, Hong Kong and India.

I'm a music enthusiast and love to strum my guitar in solitude.

I'm rarely active on social media, but I maintain profiles on most of them.
